# Predict-Car-Prices-with-Machine-Learning
I am going to walk you through how we can train a model that will help us predict car prices with Machine Learning using PyTorch. The dataset Iâ€™m going to use here to predict car prices is tabular data with the prices of different cars regarding the other variables, the dataset has 258 rows and 9 columns.
